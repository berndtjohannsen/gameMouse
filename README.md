The background is an image read from the file background.jpg at start up. The game
places 10 goal posts randomly on the screen. The goal posts are images with the names: goal1.jpg, goal2.jpg etc. 

When the start button is clicked, the cursor will turn into a car. The cursor change  depending on how it is moved (up, down, right, left and the positions in between). The player should move the 
cursor from goal 1 to goal 10 (ie the jpg files). When a goal is reached there is sound - goal.mp3 and the car continues. When the final goal is reached, there is a "confetti" effect and the file complete.mp3 is played. If the player moves to an incorrect goal (not the correct order), a sound is played (fail.mp3) and the cursor is moved back to the starting position. You will also place 4 obstacles (image files) randomly on the screen. These are denoted with the file names obst1.jpg, obst2.jpg etc. When the car drives to an obstacle a sound is played (crash.mp3) and the games stops

When the game is started a background sound is played background.mp3.
